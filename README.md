# D3-Challenge
## By: Connor Berek
## Background
For this challenge, we were tasked with making sense of state date based on a number of factors. In order to show the relationship across factors, we were asked to design scatter plots to show a correlation between factors such as obesity and median age or what I decided upon, a lack of healthcare and median household income.

By utilizing D3 library, javascript and html, I was able to design a page that shows this correlation between healthcare and median household income. It was determined that there doesn't necessarily appear to be a direct correlation between the two statewise, however I believe there is a chance that on a county or even city level between states, we can begin to see a strong correlation between median household income and a lack of healthcare.

## D3 Dabbler

1. Establish the connection to the html.index file and build the chart box.

2. Create a connection and a function using D3.

3. Parse through the necessary data that was loaded from the data.csv file.

4. Create xScale, yScale and create variables for both axes.

5. Append the axes to the chartGroup

6. Append the circles and text for the abbreviations created from the data to the chartGroup

7. Create the toolTip to show the individual stats pulled for each state. Specifically pulling median household income and the percentage of people in that state that lack healthcare.

8. Append the text to either axes and launch your html.
